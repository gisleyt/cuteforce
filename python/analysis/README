The utils sessions.py and analyze.py can be used to parse out 
statistics from certain types of event logs.

Usage: $ sort -n events.csv | python sessions.py | python analyze.py

Alternatively, pandalyze.py can be used for derive the same
statistics. pandalyze.py make better use of the pandas api, and should
be preferred over the sessions.py/analyze.py

Usage $ python pandalyze.py (presuppose that the event file is present
in /tmp/events.csv)
